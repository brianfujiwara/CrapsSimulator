# CrapsSimulator
This is a program to simulate how far your bankroll will go playing the inside numbers

The default settings for this simulator is 

Bankroll = $500
6&8 = $30 each
5&9 = $10 each 

Once the program runs you can not add, press or pull bets. This is only to simulate how long a certain bankroll would last if
betting the same bets on the inside numbers on every throw. 

Feel free to add to the code base to allow other features of the game.
